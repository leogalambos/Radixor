Dictionary size: <span class="dictionary-rating" role="img" aria-label="Relative dictionary size 4 of 5; 59,215 distinct usable word forms" title="Relative dictionary size 4 of 5; 59,215 distinct usable word forms">★★★★☆</span>. The exact count is **59,215 distinct usable word forms** after parser-compatible filtering and exact, case-preserved deduplication. Stars rank dictionary size relative to all benchmarked dictionaries in five nearly equal groups; they do **not** measure linguistic quality or benchmark accuracy.
<!-- DICTIONARY-SIZE-RATING:END -->

The language metadata declares left-to-right writing.

All speed values are environment-specific and were measured on the hardware and JVM listed in the [benchmark overview](../index.md). The command distribution, exact-root accuracy, and speed tables belong to the published 2026-09-11 Radixor/Java `4.4.0` snapshot. Speed benchmark operations process changed tokens. Accuracy uses the complete Radixor dictionary for the language.

## Dictionary Corpus

| Model ID | Model version | Language | Dictionary rows | Distinct usable forms | Complete quality tokens | Already-root tokens | Changed tokens | Timing workload | JMH timing tokens |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- | ---: |
| `xcl-default` | `1.0.0` | `XCL` | 4,300 | 59,215 | 62,753 | 4,300 | 58,453 | changed tokens | 58,453 |

## Radixor Patch Command Distribution

Radixor stores the preferred transformation for each normalized dictionary word form as a compiled patch command. This distribution shows which runtime command class is selected by the trained trie for the complete default-model dictionary. The total number of preferred patch commands analyzed for this language is **62,753**.

| Command class | Meaning | Word forms | Share |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: |
| `AppendCharacterCommand` | Appends one character to the end of the word form. | 205 | 0.327% |
| `BackwardCompoundCommand` | Applies a multi-step backward patch made from skip, delete, insert, and replace operations. | 39,315 | 62.650% |
| `DeleteSuffixCommand` | Deletes one or more trailing characters from the word form. | 15,354 | 24.467% |
| `PreserveCommand` | Returns the word form unchanged because it already matches the preferred root. | 5,113 | 8.148% |
| `ReplaceLastCharacterCommand` | Replaces the final character of the word form. | 2,766 | 4.408% |

## Accuracy

Accuracy uses the complete dictionary and reports exact agreement with the dictionary root for each identified model and candidate.

| Stemmer | All exact | Changed exact | Root preserved | Note |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Radixor | 94.362% | 94.009% | 99.163% | Exact model-ID benchmark; measured in this snapshot. |

## Speed

Speed uses JMH average time, 3 warmup iterations, 5 measurement iterations, 3 independent forks, and 1 thread.

The canonical timing workload prefers changed tokens are preferred; a root-only dictionary uses its complete root-preservation corpus. Smaller populations are repeated deterministically to the timing minimum. Relative factors use the Radixor row as the baseline.

| Stemmer | Benchmark method | Score ms/op | Error ms | ns/token | Relative vs Radixor | Note |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Radixor | `radixor[xcl-default]` | 5.759 | 1.089 | 98.5 | 1.000 | Canonical model timing workload; measured in this snapshot. |

## Interpretation Notes

- The star tier reflects only relative distinct-form count among all benchmarked dictionaries.
- Values shown above come from the identified canonical benchmark snapshot.
- Runtime and exact-root agreement describe different properties and must be interpreted together.

## Dictionary-Family Generalization Conclusion

This is the language-specific conclusion from the independent `radixor-generalization-v1` baseline
experiment. It is intentionally separate from the wider edit-cost protocol below; values from
the two frozen snapshots are not substituted for one another.

### Evidence

Model `xcl-default` version `1.0.0` is evaluated over five
predeclared nested splits. Unseen metrics remove withheld occurrences whose normalized surface
also appeared in training. Parentheses show the observed split minimum–maximum.

| Training rows | Median unseen occurrences | Unseen all exact | Unseen changed exact | Unseen root preserved |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 10% | 55,842 | 54.388% (52.421–55.202) | 52.101% (50.001–52.854) | 85.680% (85.348–88.186) |
| 20% | 49,304 | 55.229% (54.188–56.999) | 52.893% (51.734–54.752) | 87.912% (86.991–88.376) |
| 30% | 42,711 | 56.782% (53.073–58.169) | 54.478% (50.429–56.063) | 89.114% (87.743–90.095) |
| 40% | 35,893 | 56.999% (56.075–57.373) | 54.704% (53.600–55.058) | 89.458% (88.725–90.542) |
| 50% | 29,673 | 57.626% (56.787–58.976) | 55.152% (54.461–56.709) | 91.129% (89.892–91.269) |
| 60% | 23,388 | 58.873% (57.300–59.035) | 56.638% (54.842–56.787) | 91.339% (89.882–92.536) |
| 70% | 17,252 | 58.666% (57.184–59.272) | 56.257% (54.763–56.993) | 91.584% (90.761–93.926) |
| 80% | 11,645 | 60.031% (57.825–62.927) | 57.967% (55.623–60.761) | 91.565% (91.144–93.986) |
| 90% | 5,676 | 58.951% (56.973–64.152) | 56.614% (54.823–61.939) | 91.317% (90.000–95.143) |

### Generalization conclusion

- Median exactness on genuinely unseen changed forms moves from **52.101%** at 10% training knowledge to **56.614%** at 90%, a measured **+4.513 percentage-point** change.
- Unseen all-form exactness moves from **54.388%** at 10% training knowledge to **58.951%** at 90%, a measured **+4.562 percentage-point** change.
- Preservation of unseen already-root forms moves from **85.680%** at 10% training knowledge to **91.317%** at 90%, a measured **+5.636 percentage-point** change.
- The evidence establishes within-resource transfer across withheld dictionary families. It
  does not estimate unrelated domains, misspellings, arbitrary compounds, or external corpora.

The complete ten-level table and split ranges remain in the
[independent generalization report](../generalization.md); raw counters and provenance are in
[active machine-readable snapshot](../data/dictionary-generalization-2026-09-11.csv). The
[frozen methodology](../reference/generalization-methodology.md) defines family-level
splitting, unseen-surface leakage control, aggregation, and the limits of the claim.

## Stemming Quality

Runtime performance and linguistic grouping quality are independent dimensions. This section evaluates language `XCL` using the complete validated stemming-quality result matrix. Every distinct surface form is one evaluated item and can belong to several dictionary groups. Two forms are a positive pair when their group-membership sets intersect and a negative pair when those sets are disjoint. A pair shared through several groups is counted once. Exact equality with a predetermined lemma is not required.

`ALL_WORDS` includes every valid group and its original forms. `LOWERCASE_GROUPS_ONLY` excludes an entire group when any Unicode code point is uppercase or titlecase; retained words are not lowercased or otherwise rewritten. This isolates case-handling effects without changing retained inputs. [Download the complete machine-readable result snapshot](../data/stemming-quality-2026-09-11.csv).

### Evaluation Scope and Key Findings

The default model is `xcl-default`, loaded from classpath resource `org/egothor/stemmer/models/xcl-default/stemmer.gz`. The following findings compare only deterministic `PRIMARY_OUTPUT` rows over identical included groups; candidate policies are reported separately as capability analyses.

- **ALL_WORDS:** `Radixor` ranks first by balanced accuracy at **0.949840** among 1 deterministic stemmers; no same-language competitor was available. This rank does not imply leadership in throughput or every secondary metric.
- **LOWERCASE_GROUPS_ONLY:** `Radixor` ranks first by balanced accuracy at **0.949840** among 1 deterministic stemmers; no same-language competitor was available. This rank does not imply leadership in throughput or every secondary metric.
### `ALL_WORDS`

This mode contains **3 result rows**, **1 evaluated stemmers**, and **3 output policies**. Applied-row and form counts are shown per row because adapters share the language corpus but policy rows remain independently auditable. `PRIMARY_OUTPUT` and `ALL_CANDIDATES` rankings are ordered by unrounded balanced accuracy, followed by MCC, F1, over-stemming rate, over-stemming count, under-stemming rate, and stemmer. `ANY_CANDIDATE` has no single rank metric and is listed alphabetically. Balanced accuracy is a navigation metric, not a universally authoritative quality score.

#### `ANY_CANDIDATE` oracle bounds

These results are measured, not missing. `ANY_CANDIDATE` answers two separate optimistic questions for each pair: a gold-related pair avoids under-stemming when the candidate sets intersect, while a gold-negative pair avoids over-stemming when some non-colliding candidate selection exists. The oracle may choose a different candidate for the same word in different pairs. Consequently, these decisions do not form one globally realizable predicted relation or one TP/FP/FN/TN confusion matrix. Balanced accuracy, F-scores, Jaccard, Fowlkes–Mallows, and MCC are therefore mathematically **not applicable**, rather than unknown.

### Output Policies and Metric Definitions

Each distinct surface form is one item and may belong to several gold groups. Two forms are gold-related when their membership sets intersect; a relation shared by several groups is counted once. `PRIMARY_OUTPUT` uses one deterministic stem per form. `ANY_CANDIDATE` is an optimistic oracle-assisted pairwise upper bound: a gold-related pair succeeds when candidates intersect, while a gold-negative pair succeeds when a non-colliding selection exists. Candidate choices may differ between pairs, so this is not deterministic runtime behaviour and does not define one confusion matrix. `ALL_CANDIDATES` activates every returned candidate; forms are related when candidate sets intersect.

For `PRIMARY_OUTPUT` and `ALL_CANDIDATES`, `TP = underPossiblePairs - underErrorPairs`, `FN = underErrorPairs`, `FP = overErrorPairs`, and `TN = overPossiblePairs - overErrorPairs`. `ANY_CANDIDATE` publishes only its separate oracle-assisted under/over bounds; confusion-derived metrics are mathematically inapplicable and are not presented in its language-page section. Their machine-readable CSV fields remain empty. Undefined metric denominators in otherwise applicable policies are rendered as `n/a`.

- Under-stemming rate (Paice UI): `FN / (TP + FN)`, the false-negative rate over gold-related pairs.
- Over-stemming rate (Paice OI): `FP / (TN + FP)`, the false-positive rate over gold-negative pairs.
- Pairwise precision: `TP / (TP + FP)`, the fraction of predicted conflations that are gold-standard positive pairs.
- Pairwise recall: `TP / (TP + FN)`, the fraction of gold-standard positive pairs successfully connected.
- Pairwise specificity: `TN / (TN + FP)`, the fraction of gold-negative pairs correctly separated.
- Balanced accuracy: `(recall + specificity) / 2`. It gives equal weight to positive and negative pair classes and is less dominated by the large true-negative class than ordinary accuracy. It does not replace the raw errors or other metrics.
- Pairwise F-beta: `((1 + betaSquared) * TP) / (((1 + betaSquared) * TP) + (betaSquared * FN) + FP)`. F0.5 emphasizes precision and penalizes over-stemming more; F1 weights precision and recall equally; F2 emphasizes recall and penalizes under-stemming more.
- MCC: `(TP * TN - FP * FN) / sqrt((TP + FP) * (TP + FN) * (TN + FP) * (TN + FN))`. It uses all confusion counts and remains useful under class imbalance, except when its denominator is degenerate.
- Jaccard index: `TP / (TP + FP + FN)`.
- Fowlkes–Mallows index: `sqrt(precision * recall)`.
- Pairwise accuracy: `(TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)`. It can be dominated by true-negative cross-group pairs.
- Pairwise error rate: `(FP + FN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)`.

Standard ARI, homogeneity, completeness, V-measure, and NMI are not calculated: their usual contingency-table definitions require an exclusive gold partition, while this gold standard is an overlapping cover.
